## SECTION I: of the different species of philosophy.

Philosophers who speak towards the actions of human nature vs the reason behind human nature. Easy and obvious philosophy vs accurate and abtruse. As obscure as the abtruse philosophy is, ultimately it benefits all members of society. 

## SECTION II: of the origin of ideas.

**Impressions** are the more immediate perceptions of the mind, ie feelings from sensation. Thoughts or **Ideas** are recollections of the impressions, but with less vividness. Our freedoms for thought and ideas are limited by the extent of our impressions.

Proofs:

1. Complex ideas are always made of simpler ideas
2. The lack of impression or sensations correlates to lack of associated ideas (eg. a blind man having no understanding color)

One exception is the ["The Missing Shade of Blue"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Missing_Shade_of_Blue) argument, showing that an idea can be concieved without direct sensation.

An exploration of ideas that are created without impressions is required.

## SECTION III: of the association of ideas.

Through natural thinking or conversation, ideas flow from one another, indicating that there exists an [Association of Ideas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_ideas). Ideas that aren't relevant to the topic at hand are dismissed. 

A proposal of three (maybe more) principles of association:

1. Resemblance - a picture leads our thoughts to the original
2. Contiguity - a location in our home city leads to other locations nearby
3. Cause and Effect - thinking of a wound brings reflection of the pain

## SECTION IV: sceptical doubts concerning the operations of the understanding.

### Part One

Two kinds of human reason:

1. Relation of Ideas
2. Matters of Fact

*Relation of Ideas* are discoverable by thought without dependance on experience

*Matters of Fact* 

## SECTION IV: sceptical doubts concerning the operations of the understanding.
## SECTION V: sceptical solution of these doubts.
## SECTION VI: of probability.
## SECTION VII: of the idea of necessary connexion.
## SECTION VIII: of liberty and necessity.
## SECTION IX: of the reason of animals.
## SECTION X: of miracles.
## SECTION XI: of a particular providence and of a future state.
## SECTION XII: of the academical or sceptical philosophy.

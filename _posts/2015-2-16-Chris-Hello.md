My name is Chris. I've created this website to serve as a hub for documenting my extracurricular efforts in life. This includes various projects I'm working on, notes on books I'm reading, and general thoughts. To begin, we'll begin by discussing the ever-growing topic of Bitcoin. 

Everyone has heard of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/), but no one knows exactly what the hell it is. Back in May 2014, [Coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com), a Bitcoin exchange, was offering $10 USD for new accounts that signed up with a .edu email address. Free money!? I immediately made a new account, but just as fast, I lost interest in following up with the account. Fast forward to today, with my renewed vigor for learning about Bitcoin, I log back onto my account, redeem the "$10 USD", and find out that the value of the Bitcoin has dropped almost 50% since May2014. The $10 was now only worth $5.27. So the new currency of our generation has dropped 50% in less than a year!? Guess I have more to learn about Bitcoin.

What do I plan on doing with my rich sum of $5.27? I figure a good way to learn Bitcoin is to donate. My donation recipient? [NASA](http://www.penny4nasa.org/donate), who actually takes Bitcoin for donations! Neil Degrasse Tyson would be so proud of me, right?

But wait! You can transfer Bitcoin from the exchange (Coinbase.com) to an encrypted wallet that's on your computer. One of the security highlights of the Bitcoin technology is that all users have a "transcript" of all transactions that have taken place. With everyone having access to the "transcript", this makes it hard for hackers to steal Bitcoins. This  transcript is around 20GB in size, is downloaded to your computer, and is kept up-to-date everytime you use your wallet. 20GB takes a long time to download and transactions for your wallet won't update until the download is completed. I guess my Bitcoin is stuck in limbo and NASA will have to wait a few days...

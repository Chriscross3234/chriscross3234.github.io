*I know that I know nothing* - Socrates

We can discuss my forays into philosophy in a another post. For now, I'm inundated in learning everything surrounding building this website: Python, Git, Jekyll, Markdown, HTML, the list goes on.

But, there's that eternal reminder that one little-known philosopher said long long ago.

title: I Know That I Know Nothing

*I know that I know nothing* - Socrates

We can discuss my forays into philosophy in a another post. For now, I'm inundated in learning everything surrounding building this website: Python, Git, Jekyll, Markdown, HTML, the list goes on. For now, the site will look like crap. To my reliefe I will always find pleasure in learning. Learning to gain new skills, new experiences, new perspectives. But, no matter how much one has learned, there's that eternal reminder that one little-known philosopher said long long ago.

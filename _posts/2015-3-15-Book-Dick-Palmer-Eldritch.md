#The Review

What if your dreams allowed you to alter the past? To see the future? To face your regrets? These questions are the focus of Phillip Dick's The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch. With the life of misery on Earth and on colonies within the solar system, comes the use of a drug that provides escape. The escape is the same constant, familiar story of the good life. For mysterious reasons, a new drug enters the foray. One that allows the user to create and imagine new worlds, not just the same contrived experience over and over again. The new drug provides visions of the past, present, and future, all blurring together and leading to the questioning of reality itself.

I gave this book three stars, although I was very close to giving four. The ideas are fresh, but the execution felt lacking. Discovering the effects of the drugs was a blast to read. But the overall story arc seemed muddled with loose ends. 

#Some thoughts about the book (Spoilers!):

- Barney, the pre-cog, had the most interesting storyline. A man who could predict trends for the Can-D drug and touted as a future-seeing pre-cog. However, he was unable to foresee that actions that would lead him to volunteering as a colonist on Mars. Perhaps this is a critique on the human qualities of "pride" and "ego" blinding even someone who can see the future. This blindness leads Barney down the wrong path of leaving his wife (Emily) and betraying his boss (Leo). We see it as the "wrong" path with Barney showing regret when he attempts to change the past when using the new drug Chew-Z. Trying to reach so far, he pushes the limit of his use with Chew-Z and highly risks concious encorporation with Palmer Eldritch and ultimately his semi-desired death. Another conclusion driven by Barney's inability to see the future.
- Once again, the issue of human pride arises with the story of Richard and Emily. Trying to make ends meet, Richard hastily accepts a deal with an unknown vendor without Emily's consent. With the newly acquired weatlth, the next step to climb the social ladder is to undergo gene therapy, accelerating the speed of human evolution in a similar fashion of going to the dentist (a very costly one). Once there, the doctor wards that the therapy could backfire and actually revert the evolution ever so slightly. They proceed with the therapy, Richard comes out successful while Emily suffers regression. Emily, a great artist, now is stunted and limited to making pottery that she made years ago. Sometimes the risk is too high for the reward, Richard is left to think otherwise.

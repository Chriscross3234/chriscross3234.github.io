title: First Post and Bitcoin Discoveries
---

My name is Chris. I've created this website to serve as a hub for documenting my extracurricular efforts in life. This includes various projects I'm working on, notes on books that I'm reading, and general thoughts that I have. To begin, we'll begin by discussing the ever growing topic of Bitcoin. 

Everyone has heard of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/), but has no exact idea of what the hell it is or what it's used for. Back in May 2014, the [Bitcoin Bowl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_Bowl) took place, using a sporting event to further Bitcoin into the mainstream. [Coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com), a Bitcoin exchange, was offering $10 USD for new accounts that signed up with a .edu email address. I made a new account, but soon lost interest in following up with the account. Fast forwarding to today with my renewed vigor of learning about Bitcoin, I log back onto my account, redeem the "$10 USD", and find out that the value of the Bitcoin has dropped almost 50% since May2014. The $10 was now only worth $5.27. So the new currency of our generation has dropped 50% in less than a year!? Guess I have more to learn about Bitcoin.

What do I plan on doing with my rich sum of $5.27? I figure a good way to learn Bitcoin is to donate. My donation recipient? [Nasa!](http://www.penny4nasa.org/donate) They actually take Bitcoin! 

But wait! You can transfer Bitcoin from the exchange (Coinbase.com) to your actually wallet that's on your computer. One of the security highlights of the Bitcoin technology is that all users have a "transcript" of all transactions that have taken place. This 20GB transcript is actually downloaded to your computer and kept up to date everytime you use your wallet. 20GB is a lot to download and transactions for your wallet won't update until the download is completed... Guess NASA will have to wait a few days.
